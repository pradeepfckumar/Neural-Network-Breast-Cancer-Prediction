# Neural-Network-Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This file demonstrate the process of building and training a neural network model to predict breast cancer. It covers data loading, preprocessing, splitting data, applying feature scaling using StandardScaler, defining Keras sequential model, visualizing the model's performance, evaluating the model and predicting as 'Malignant' or 'Benign
